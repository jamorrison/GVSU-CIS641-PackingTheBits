The sequencing process requires collecting DNA from a sample (e.g., a tumor biopsy or a healthy tissue nearby), extracting the DNA from the cells, and then fragmenting the full length DNA strands into smaller chunks. These chunks are then placed on a “sequencer,” where the individual bases are read from the DNA fragments. The output from the sequencer is called a “read” and is then aligned back to a reference genome (the human reference genome is about three billion bases long) in order to find where the small fragment (usually around 100-150 bases in length) came from.\nOne possible analysis that can be done is to find the “coverage” across the entire genome. To do this, you count the total number of reads that cover each individual loci, or base, in the genome. One example of performing this analysis is as a part of a quality control pipeline within BISCUIT (a project I maintain for work) to verify a sequencing experiment consistently covered the entire genome. Currently, the pipeline uses bedtools to do this, but it is a slow process. One option for improving the speed of this process would be to use mosdepth, a tool specifically designed for finding coverages. However, it does not calculate the exact metrics that I need.\nI propose writing a small tool that improves upon the existing bedtools implementation and calculates the metrics I need on the fly. The tool will be written in C for plugging in to BISCUIT following the completion of class. It will also be multithreaded to improve the efficiency of the single-threaded bedtools option. Depending on the final state of the project, it may be sufficient to warrant an academic publication (either as a pre-print or a peer-reviewed application note).\n\n\nAnticipated Technologies\n\nOS: macOS or Linux\nEditor: vim\nLanguage: C\nThird-Party Libraries:\n\nhtslib\nPOSIX threads\nzlib\n\n\n\n\nMethod/Approach\nBroadly, I plan to start off with doing as much analysis and design ahead of time as I can. This will include defining as many requirements at the outset of the project (although I anticipate having to revise these during the implementation stage). I plan to give myself the most time on the implementation stage, with an approximately equal amount of time for analysis, design, and implementation. Testing will have a shorter amount of dedicated time; however, I plan to write some of the tests during the implementation stage. For the sake of this project, most of my tests will focus on the output of the tool to ensure it returns the same values as before. I will include some unit tests on some of the smaller functionality, but these won’t be the focus of my tests.\n\n\nEstimated Timeline\n\n\n\nTask\nEstimated Completion Date\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n30 September 2024\n\n\nDesign\n14 October 2024\n\n\nRequirements\n14 October 2024\n\n\nImplementation\n14 November 2024\n\n\nTesting\n31 November 2024\n\n\nWrapping Up\n6 December 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAnticipated Problems\nPotential problems include, but are not limited to:\n\nDesign\n\nCreating class diagrams\n\nImplementation\n\nHandling reads that span adjacent regions handled by different threads\nMerging regions of similar coverage that span adjacent regions\nHandling regions of interest to calculate metrics for\n\nTesting\n\nUnit testing",

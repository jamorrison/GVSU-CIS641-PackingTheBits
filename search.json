    "text": "GVSU CIS 641 Project\nAs a part of my M.S. in Applied Computer Science at GVSU, I took CIS 641: Systems Analysis and Design which required a full semester project as a part of the homework.\nFor my project, I worked on a tool which calculates the “coverage” across an entire genome. A genome is the full set of A’s, T’s, C’s, and G’s that comprise a species’ DNA. The coverage is the number of “reads” (small chunks of DNA that have been sequenced), that span a given location in the genome. One of the tools I maintain at work is BISCUIT, which aligns reads to their correct location in the genome. It has a quality control step that finds the coverage to ensure a sequencing experiment has consistently covered the entire genome. Currently, the quality control step uses bedtools, but it is slow and I took the opportunity provided by my full semester project to work to improve the speed of this process. It was written in C in order to plug in to BISCUIT following completion of the class and is multithreaded for improved processing efficiency.",

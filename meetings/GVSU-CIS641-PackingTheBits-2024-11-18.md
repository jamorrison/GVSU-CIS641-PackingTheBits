## Meeting minutes

Team name: Packing the Bits

Members present: Jacob Morrison

Date: 18 November 2024

Time: 15:50

Discussion points: 

* Thoughts on what I want to do for testing
  * Create script to create benchmarking new version against old
    * Can use to test speed of processing
    * Can make sure the new version is faster than the old version (and worth the effort)
  * Create test files to check if different options change results or not
    * It's okay if results change, but I need to know how so I can explain to users when this is deployed
* Homework 5 (class diagrams) started and almost done

Goals for next week (include responsibilities):

All responsibilities handled by Jacob Morrison

* Must complete a base level of testing to wrap up other elements of project
* Finish HW5 (class diagrams)
